## About

Hi, I'm Emily! I have a technical background and hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Environmental Science from Washington College. I've worn several hats working in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), sustainable agriculture research, and habitat monitoring in the Gulf of Mexico. I'm currently a Data Analyst with a produce company and am taking classes to develop my skills further. 

This repository/portfolio is a means to track my progress and showcase my skills in Data Analytics.
